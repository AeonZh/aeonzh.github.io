Logical replication uses native PostgreSQL replication slots to record data-modifying statements or row changes on the replication source (primary) and reapply them on the replication target (replica). The primary and replica databases are separate and independent and can contain different datasets.</p><h1 id=what-aurora-offers>What Aurora offers</h1><ul><li>MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility</li><li>Involves <strong>clusters</strong> instead of single instances.

Logical replicas basically re-applies the database modifications to a new database. Physical replicas are sort of literally the same database. Aurora does the former, I assume because of the storage nature? There is <strong>Aurora Global Database</strong> for cross-region replicas.</li><li>&ldquo;You can typically promote a secondary cluster and make it available for writes in under a minute.&rdquo;</li><li>With <strong>endpoints</strong> you don&rsquo;t have to point to the single hostnames, AWS does it for you, hence a little bit of management relief (I believe)</li></ul><h1 id=question-i-still-have>Question I still have</h1><ul><li>A part from the fact that Aurora, due the infrastructure is faster than traditional RDS. Conceptually, having cross-region RDS replicas and using Aurora Global Database are the same?
<em>Update after some months of use:</em> the result would be very similar, the gains would be in terms of performance (storage-only clones VS creating entire instance replicas)</li></ul><h2>Backlinks</h2></div></main><footer><span>&copy; <time datetime="2021-02-20 04:24:02.676002959 +0000 UTC m=+0.053679216">2021</time> Zheng He Hu.
