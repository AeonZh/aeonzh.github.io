Whether we choose to take it or get assigned to it. We may break the job into sub-task and start to tackle the first on the list. Divide and conquer, like the good engineers we&rsquo;ve learned to be. All this in the hope of chipping down our ever-growing backlog. In my day to day job I work as a DevOps Engineer, or Platform/Infrastructure Engineer for people screaming &ldquo;DevOps is a culture&rdquo; (not calling out any of my colleagues :P) and this mostly means creating and maintaining infrastructure resources code, debugging application build and deploy errors thrown by the pipeline etc. I do enjoy it a lot, as it permits me to touch different technologies, cycle them and never get bored.</p><p>All seems good, until I find a piece that doesn&rsquo;t look right. In my case this can happen in the form of an unexpected behaviour or inconsistency, because of some code that I wrote in the past with less experience and it was depending on a module that needed to be refactored to accept a new functionality, which required to refactor all the components that depended on that module. So, in order to reduce complexity, I&rsquo;d think a way to decoupled the scope and responsibilities of the module, unless there was a better design pattern that I could use and I decide to do more research instead&mldr; Wait&mldr; What was I doing again?</p><p>When I read this, it looks so comically exaggerated that reminds me a <a href=https://youtu.be/AbSehcT19u0>scene of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em></a>, where the father, Hal, tries to fix a broken light bulb.</p><p>This unfortunately happens all the time. It may be in our nature, as beings guided by curiosity and that get excited at novelty. I get lured by these fireflies, jump to catch them, fail, I become so focused on understanding their behaviour to improve my success rates, wader off a while. Only to find myself in the depths of a rabbit hole. I love the iconic characters, the setting and the themes in Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland. Although, if I have to be completely honest, I never read the original work by L. Carroll, but I digress&mldr;</p><p>Back to our previous rabbit hole. While the learning outcomes will probably help me in other aspects of my life, it is often worth it to stop. Step back. Take a deep breath and ask to myself. Will this ever end? I suppose not. Even when I thought I &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; the root issue, I can totally imagine a future me reading the same line of code and thinking &ldquo;who is the illiterate that wrote this?&rdquo; With time comes experience, experience may change the opinions I used to stand by and my idea of perfection. For this same reason I am publishing this stream of consciousness. Not only, trying to achieve my current idea of perfection is a misuse of resources, perfect is the enemy of done and code not shipped is not generating value. I am not trying to say that the value of profits should be above everything else, but I believe that in the real world I should put the shared goals above my own pride and thirst of knowledge.</p><p>I am going to revisit this page some time in the future, while leaving some link that was resonating with me.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.beingproductive.org/2020/08/getting-lost-and-angry-changing-a-light-bulb/>Getting Lost and Angry Changing a Light Bulb</a></li><li><a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/conquer-legacy-code-f9e23a6ab758/>How to conquer legacy code</a></li><li><a href=https://lifehacker.com/dont-fall-into-the-trap-of-precrastination-1844580800>Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of precrastination</a></li></ul></div><div class=pagination><a href=# class=top>Top</a></div></main><footer><span>&copy; <time datetime="2021-02-08 22:55:43.957384 +0000 GMT m=+0.089283777">2021</time> .
